  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Background</p>
      <p>My decision to pursue web development began in 2020 during the height of the Coronavirus pandemic. I am currently a massage therapist, so, consequently, my career was put on hold until I got vaccinated. I realized I needed to seek a profession that provided me stability, but also something to satisfy my itch to learn something new. I brainstormed a few routes I could take that would fit my needs, and after testing a couple, I landed at Epicodus. I feel confident that my peers and I will enjoy and ultimately succeed in our chosen career paths!</p>

      <p>Hobbies</p>
      <p>Music is my <strong>ultimate</strong> passion, so therefore my hobbies revolve around it. I love singing, dancing, going to shows and festivals, and I also dabble in making experimental electronic music. Other activities I enjoy are yoga, trail running, biking, thrifting, exploring new coffee shops and bakeries, nintendo, and anime.</p>

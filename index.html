        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </div>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My decision to pursue web development began in 2020 during the height of the Coronavirus pandemic. I am currently a massage therapist, so, consequently, my career was put on hold until I got vaccinated. I realized I needed to seek a profession that provided me stability, but also something to satisfy my itch to learn something new. I brainstormed a few routes I could take that would fit my needs, and after testing a couple, I landed at <span class="epicodus">Epicodus</span>. I feel confident that my peers and I will enjoy and ultimately succeed in our chosen career paths!</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p><img src="cookie.jpg" alt="Cookies">Music is my <strong>ultimate</strong> passion, so therefore my hobbies revolve around it. I love singing, dancing, going to shows and festivals, and I also dabble in making experimental electronic music. Other activities I enjoy are yoga, trail running, biking, thrifting, exploring new coffee shops and bakeries, nintendo, and anime.</p>
        <h3>Things I <em>Thoroughly</em> Enjoy</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Spending Time with Friends and Family</li>
          <li>My Bed</li>
          <li>Beaches</li>
          <li>Cute Things</li>
          <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
